# Cedar Rapids Buyouts #

## Background ##

- Cedar Rapids experienced severe flooding in June 2008
- Recovery included a federally-funded land acquisition program
     - Idea is to buyout homeowners in flood-prone areas (ie, near Cedar River)
     - Program is *voluntary*
     - Eligibility depends on federal grant (HMGP, CDBG), flood exposure, and 
       benefit-cost ratio 
       [Tate et al. (2015)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11069-015-2060-8)
         - **TODO**: Determine eligiility in the data (currently assuming flooded == 
         eligible)
- Based on federal grant and hazard exposure, about 1300 properties acquired
  under one of three designations:
     - Construction Area
     - Greenway Area
     - Neighborhood Revitalization Area
- Properties were acquired over the period 2009-2014
     - Many properties acquired under condition there will be no future
       reconstruction (hence reducing future hazard exposure)
     - [TODO] Check restrictions on how long homeowner can stay *if they reject buyout*
       
## Research questions ##

- What do people do and where do they go?
- What is value of home in 2016, conditional on rejecting buyout?
- What is value of home in 2016, conditional on accepting buyout (and staying in Cedar Rapids)?
