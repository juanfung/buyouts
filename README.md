# Cedar Rapids Buyouts #

## Background ##

- Cedar Rapids experienced severe flooding in June 2008
- Recovery included a federally-funded land acquisition program
     - Idea is to buyout homeowners in flood-prone areas (ie, near Cedar River)
     - Program is *voluntary*
- Based on federal grant and hazard exposure, about 1500 properties identified
  for buyout under one of three designations:
     - Construction Area
     - Greenway Area
     - Neighborhood Revitalization Area
- Properties were acquired over the period 2009-2014
     - Many properties acquired under condition there will be no future
       reconstruction (hence reducing future hazard exposure)
       
## Research questions ##

- What do people do and where do they go?
